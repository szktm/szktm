### Hi there 👋
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a web app that helps to manage volunteer English teachers and migrant worker students for ItsRainingRaincoats!
- Sometimes secretly wish that I was studying a CS degree instead, but past me made the best choice she could at age 18 and present me is trying her best to finish what past me started. (Or maybe it's just sunk cost fallacy)
